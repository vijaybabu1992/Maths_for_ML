    "# Exploratory Data Analysis - Intro to Pandas\n",
    "Welcome to the Pandas tutorial lab. This is the first notebook of the exploratory data analysis (EDA) series, where you will get your hands dirty applying the skills you have learned in the course on an actual data problem, similar to those you might encouter in real life! Here you will see and try out some basics of Pandas and get familiar with some of the useful functions that you will use across the other labs and assignments. If you already know Pandas well, feel free to skip this notebook.\n",

    "For the demonstration purposes you will use the [World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report/) dataset. The dataset consists of 2199 rows, where each row contains various hapiness-related metrics for a certain country in a given year. Right now you'll just use this dataset to understand some fundamental operations in Pandas. You will see this dataset again later in week 3, where you will dig deeper into the data and explore relationships to better understand which factors seem to best predict happiness.\n",
