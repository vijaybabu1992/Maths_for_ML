About this Course
In this course, learners will be able to:

•  Analytically optimize different types of functions commonly used in machine learning using properties of derivatives and gradients 
•  Approximately optimize different types of functions commonly used in machine learning using first-order (gradient descent) and second-order (Newton’s method) iterative methods
• Visually interpret differentiation of different types of functions commonly used in machine learning
• Perform gradient descent in neural networks with different activation and cost functions 

Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data science is a foundational online program created by DeepLearning.AI and taught by Luis Serrano. This beginner-friendly program is where you’ll master the fundamental mathematics toolkit of machine learning.

Many machine learning engineers and data scientists need help with mathematics, and even experienced practitioners can feel held back by a lack of math skills. This Specialization uses innovative pedagogy in mathematics to help you learn quickly and intuitively, with courses that use easy-to-follow plugins and visualizations to help you see how the math behind machine learning actually works. 

Upon completion, you’ll understand the mathematics behind all the most common algorithms and data analysis techniques — plus the know-how to incorporate them into your machine learning career.

This is a beginner-friendly program, with a recommended background of at least high school mathematics (functions, basic algebra). We also recommend a basic familiarity with Python (loops, functions, if/else statements, lists/dictionaries, importing libraries) , as labs use Python and Jupyter Notebooks to demonstrate learning objectives in the environment where they’re most applicable to machine learning and data science.
